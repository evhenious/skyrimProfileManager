skyrimProfileManager
====================
SkyrimProfileManager - simple managing tool for game saves on local computer. Allows easy play with different characters, or saves backup.
Can create, activate/deactivate, delete profiles. Each profile stores own saves in separate directory created by this tool, so profiles are not interfere anyhow.

To install, just copy .exe file in skyrim directory that contains 'Saves' directory. 
Thats it! (needs administrator permissions to work)
